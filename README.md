# What I will be building:
A platform that takes video as an input and produces bite-sized blogs for [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) optimization.

# Motivation
The inspiration behind this idea comes from [perplexity pages](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/perplexity-pages). In the future, answer engines will need more information to index into, which requires companies to proactively push their marketing online. Just look at [jotbot](https://myjotbot.com/blog) and [this](). You don't need quality content, you just need more of it to feed into answer engines and they will index fine on perplexity or phind. Although Google have ways in preventing the [gamifcation](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/diagnose-fix-google-penalty), if you believe in answer engines, AI agents, then optimizing for keywords are future-proof solutions. Most startups pursuing traction will do this — and there's honestly no problem with it. 

More so, influencers who primarly use video (youtubers, tiktokkers, ig reels) are able to control the media surrounding their likeness and brand, they can provide more relevant and factual informations about themselves or their businesses. I believe that twelvelabs has the opportunity to do this with their [Pegasus-1](https://www.twelvelabs.io/blog/introducing-pegasus-1) video-to-text model.

This was also a good recipe I [found](https://playground.twelvelabs.io/indexes/65eff5b16dc02a0c6004a059/generate?v=65f0045566995fbd9fd64d7d&cache=true&mode=template&st=chapter&cp=Divide+the+chapters+step+by+step+introduced+in+this+video).

# Engineering Process

I'm going to keep this app dead simple. Here are the functional requirements:
- input some video (youtube link should work)
- output some blog 
- allow users to make some quick changes
- allow users to "share" (can mock this)
- must be beautiful in some way

Tech stack:
- nextjs + ts, tailwind, python, aws, nextui

users don't really know what they want to build. so they

# Moving Forward
This is a pretty cool idea...
Stretch:
- if we can have a blogger-tool.twelvelabs.io website wheere people can immeidately deploy their blogging stuff then that would be awesome. THey don't need to create their own website or blog site, they can just outsource to twelvelabs and twelvelabs create their blogs for them.

but if i really wanted to build something at twelvelabs it would be a big product or a big idea, and as a dev ex engineer i'm committed to building the moonshot products that would put twelvelabs on the map.


Other ideas in my backlog:
- need a simple way to share clips with people. If I can quickly index and search within videos, turn them into clips, and share them efficiently wouldn't that be awesome.



I'm sure there are companies already working on AI generated SEO content, and it's quite depressing to know that we are entering the [dead internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory) age.
